# Stanford-Machine-Learning

This repository contains all the lab assignments I completed in order to finish the Stanford Machine Learning course on Coursera taught by Professor Andrew Ng. This course outlines the fundamental concepts and algorithms behind many machine learning models in use today, and through labs, enables students to implement their own machine learning models. The lab assignments were completed using Octave, which Professor Ng believes to be the best programming language in order for students to start learning about machine learning algorithms. 

## Key Topics

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression & Regularization
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Anomaly Detection
- Recommender Systems
- etc.
